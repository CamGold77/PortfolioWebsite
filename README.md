# Library-Themed Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my journey, skills, and experiences. The theme revolves around a cozy library where interactive elements such as books and a phone bring the content to life. Each book represents a section of the website, including:
- **About Me**
- **Papers** (summaries of my published research)
- **Experience**
- **Projects**

The phone acts as a central hub for contacting me and linking to my professional pages, like LinkedIn and GitHub.

---

## Features
- **3D and 2D Integration**: Built with React.js and Three.js for immersive interactivity.
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable books open to reveal content, and the phone provides access to external links.
- **Library-Themed Design**: Aesthetic design mimicking a personal study.

---

## Current Status ðŸš§
This website is **under construction** and represents my current project. While the core design and functionality are being implemented, Iâ€™m actively adding content, animations, and refining interactivity.

---

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Front-end framework for building the website.
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: For creating 3D elements and interactivity.
- **GSAP**: For animations and smooth transitions.
- **Blender**: For 3D modeling and asset creation.
